# Theme Grep by BoldGrid #

Theme Grep is a plugin designed to help review WordPress themes. While [Theme Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/) and [Theme Sniffer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-sniffer/) are designed to find specific issues, Theme Grep was built to help automate some of the searches (greps) used to "snoop around" the theme's code.

Greps are configured within the [includes/config/config.plugin.php](https://github.com/BoldGrid/boldgrid-theme-grep/blob/master/includes/config/config.plugin.php) file.
